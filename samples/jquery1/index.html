  <!-- Our steps -->
  <section id="step1">

    <p>1. Create a MIDI channel strip to your project. Once a MIDI channel strip is added, look up Sylenth1 in the search bar and drag it to your MIDI channel strip.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="step2">

    <p>2. In Sylenth1, go to the "Menu" at the top left of the digital screen in the center of the plugin. Once in "Menu", move your mouse to the "Preset" section which will be the first topic in the "Menu" listing. Inside "Preset", move your mouse to the word, "Insert". Click on "Insert" and Sylenth1 will revert to the INIT preset.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="step3">

    <p> 3. Both oscillators in Sylenth1 are loacted at the topic left and right of the plugin screen. Each oscillator contains a section in which the user chooses a waveform. It is located directly below the "Phase" knob. "Oscillator A1" will already contain a Saw waveform by default. The user will need to change the waveform in "Oscillator A2" to a Saw wave, pictured above.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="step4">
  <img width="550" src="images/step4.png" alt="">
    <p>4. Each oscillator ccontains a "Voices" section, in which another layer of the waveform is added every time a voice is added. The "Voices" section is located directly to the right of the "Wave" section. Drag the mouse over to the "Voices" section and drag up slowly, adding voices. Increase the voices to eight for each oscillator. After that, turn off "Retrig" which is located in the bottom right corner of each Oscillator. Once turned off, the "Retrig" light will turn off.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="step5">
    <img width="550" src="images/step5.png" alt="">
    <p> 5. Each voice added in the previous section can be detuned, creating a sense of fullness in the sound. To achieve this effect, turn the "Detune" knob in both oscillators, one to the ten-o'clock position and one to the eleven-o'clock position. The "Detune" knob is located in the middle of the five knobs in each oscillator.</p>
